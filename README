chromium-image-toggler
======================

Chrome extension to hide/show images on page load. 

Let me know if you would like to work on this project!

This extension allows you to toggle images on a page using a key combination (Ctrl+i). For example,
if you're browsing at work but don't want prying eyes, or simply don't want images to be shown
then you would hit Ctrl+i. This will hide the images. Hitting it again would show the images.

Options:

- Show/hide images by default
    Allows you to set the default behavior for page loads
- Ignore new content after page has loaded (Recommended for performance)
    This is for pages like instagram.com that add content dynamically
- Ignore background images	  (Recommended to maintain the UI)
    This is for pages like instagram.com that contain background images.
    They use CSS instead of "a" tags
- Transparency for hidden images.
    You may want to have images transparent instead of totally hidden.
    This makes it easier to notice images on the page
- Reveal hidden images on mouseover
    Allows you to show hidden images when you put the mouse cursor over them
Reveal speed
    Allows you to adjust how quickly a hidden image is fully shown
- Customized pages
    Allows you to allow each web page to behave differently
    You can change all of the options above for specific web pages, domains, etc
